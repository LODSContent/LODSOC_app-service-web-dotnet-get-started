# ASP.NET sample for Azure App Service

   >**NOTE:** This repo is a copy of an [Azure Sample repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-dotnet-get-started) to support a number of LODS challenge labs by ensuring that any dependent lab content remains static and not subject to change in a way that would break the labs that depend on it. 

This is an ASP.NET MVC web app that you can deploy to Azure App Service using Git. 

This code is the default MVC app as generated by 
[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs).

To learn how to deploy this starter web app to App Service in a few minutes, go to 
[Get started with web apps in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-get-started/).
